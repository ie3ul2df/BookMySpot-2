## UX-Design

### User Research

Before starting the design, research was conducted to understand the target users and their needs. This helped define the core functionalities of the platform and how it should be structured.

- **Target Audience**: The main users are drivers looking for parking spaces and parking space owners willing to rent out their spots.
- **User Needs**: Drivers need a quick and easy way to find and book parking spots. Parking space owners need an intuitive way to list, manage, and update their parking spots.

### Information Architecture

The site is structured to meet the needs of both parking space owners and drivers. Key pages and features include:

- **Home Page**: A landing page that introduces the platform and allows users to navigate to the key sections.
- **Login/Register**: Authentication pages for users to sign in or create an account.
- **Search Page**: A map-based interface where drivers can search for available parking spots.
- **Profile Page**: Users can view and manage their profile, bookings, and spots (for owners).
- **Admin Dashboard**: For admins to manage users, listings, and monitor platform activity.

### Wireframes

Wireframes are visual representations of the layout of each page of the application, focusing on functionality and placement of elements rather than design details. These wireframes include mobile, tablet, and desktop versions to ensure the design is responsive.

- **Home Page**: Shows the welcome message, navigation, and search bar.
- **Search Page**: Displays a map and list of available parking spots.
- **Login/Register Page**: Contains forms for user registration and login.
- **Profile Page**: Displays user profile information and options to update details or view bookings.
- **Admin Dashboard**: A page for the admin to manage users and listings.

Below are the wireframes for the main pages of the BookMySpot website.

### Homepage Wireframe

The Homepage wireframe outlines the basic structure and layout of the main landing page. It includes navigation, a hero section, features, testimonials, and a footer. This page is designed to give visitors an overview of the platform.

![About Us Page Wireframe](assets/img/wireframes/about_us.avif)

### Mockups

Once the wireframes were finalized, high-fidelity mockups were created to define the visual style, color scheme, and typography of the platform. These mockups provide a clearer idea of how the final site will look.

- **Home Page**: Features a clean and simple design with a strong call to action (CTA) for users to start searching for parking spots.
- **Login/Register Page**: Simple form design with clear instructions.
- **Search and Booking Page**: A user-friendly map interface with filters to help drivers find parking spaces easily.
- **Profile and Admin Pages**: Organized with easy-to-use controls for managing listings, bookings, and account settings.

### Home page Mockup

![Homepage Mockup](assets/img/mockups/home_page_mockup.avif)

### Custom Colors

In order to give the platform a unique identity, the default Bootstrap colors have been customized to fit the branding of **BookMySpot**. The primary color scheme has been adjusted to incorporate a warm, yellow tone for the primary actions, and a dark theme for text and buttons.

The following custom color palette is applied throughout the platform:

- **Primary Color**: #fed136 (Bright Yellow) - Used for key actions like buttons and highlights.
- **Primary Text Emphasis**: #665416 (Dark Yellow) - Used for text and accents.
- **Primary Background Subtle**: #FFF6D7 (Light Yellow) - Used for backgrounds in light mode.
- **Primary Border Subtle**: #FFEDAF (Soft Yellow) - Used for borders around buttons and forms.

All buttons have been customized to match the primary branding color, offering distinct hover, active, and disabled states:

- **Primary Button**:

  - Background Color: #fed136 (Bright Yellow)
  - Hover Color: #FED854 (Lighter Yellow)
  - Active Color: #FEDA5E (Even Lighter Yellow)

- **Outline Primary Button**:

  - Border Color: #fed136 (Bright Yellow)

1. **HTML Validation**:

   Tool: [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)
   This tool was used to validate the HTML code to ensure it adheres to W3C standards, helping to detect and fix any potential issues in the markup.

   - Home Page, index.html file:
     ![index.html code validate screenshot image](assets/img/code-validate/index.html-validator.w3.org-image.JPG)
   - About us Page, about-us.html file:
     ![about-us.html code validate screenshot image](assets/img/code-validate/about-us.html-validator.w3.org-image.JPG)
   - Privacy and Policies Page, privacy.html file:
     ![privacy.html code validate screenshot image](assets/img/code-validate/privacy.html-validator.w3.org-image.JPG)
   - Form submit Page, privacy.html file:
     ![form-submit.html code validate screenshot image](assets/img/code-validate/form-submit.html-validator.w3.org-image.JPG)

2. **JavaScript Validation**:

Used [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for unit tests.

- agancy.js file:

- form-submit.js file:
  ![form-submit.js code validate screenshot image](assets/img/code-validate/form-submit.js-jshint.com-image.JPG)

3. **CSS Validation**:

Tool: [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
The CSS code was validated using this tool to ensure that the stylesheets are free from syntax errors and compliant with CSS standards.

- Style.css file:
  ![style.css code validate screenshot image](assets/img/code-validate/style.css-jigsaw.w3.org-image.JPG)

### Bug Tracking

- **Footer Alignment Issue**:  
  The footer was not staying at the bottom of the page on short-content pages. This issue was resolved by using Bootstrap's `d-flex` class on the `<body>` element and `flex-grow-1` on the `<main>` element, ensuring the footer remains anchored to the bottom of the viewport.

- **Navbar Active Page Highlighting**:  
  The navbar did not correctly indicate the active page or section on load or during scrolling. The issue was resolved by implementing JavaScript logic to dynamically update the active state of navbar links and dropdown items based on the current URL and scroll position.

- **Contact Form Field Validation**:  
  The contact form lacked proper input validation, allowing invalid data to be submitted. This was resolved by adding appropriate HTML5 attributes (`type`, `required`, and `pattern`) to ensure that the inputs for name, email, and phone adhere to valid formats.

### Testing Results

- **HTML Validator**: No major issues were found after running the validation.
- **CSS Validator**: A few minor warnings were addressed, ensuring proper syntax and consistency across all styles.
- **Autoprefixer**: All relevant CSS rules were successfully prefixed to ensure compatibility across browsers.
